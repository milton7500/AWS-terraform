# AWS Resource Creation Using Terraform

This repository demonstrates how to create AWS resources using Terraform.  It provides examples and templates for common AWS services.

**Contents:**

* **`main.tf`:**  The main Terraform configuration file. This file defines the infrastructure to be created.  This will include resource definitions, providers, and variables.
* **`variables.tf`:** Defines variables used in the `main.tf` file.  This allows for easy customization without modifying the core infrastructure code.  (Example:  AWS region, instance type, etc.)
* **`outputs.tf`:** Defines outputs from the Terraform execution.  This allows you to easily access important information about the created resources, such as their IDs and public IP addresses.
* **`providers.tf` (Optional):**  Specifically defines providers (like the AWS provider).  This is often included for clarity, especially in larger projects.


**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
   * Configure AWS credentials.  Terraform needs access to your AWS account. You can configure this using AWS access keys, environment variables, or an IAM role.  See the AWS documentation for details.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   This downloads the necessary AWS provider plugins.

4. **Plan the Changes:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
   This shows you what resources Terraform will create or modify.

5. **Apply the Changes:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   This creates the resources in your AWS account.  **Review the plan carefully before applying.**

6. **Destroy the Resources (when finished):**
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
   This deletes the resources created by Terraform.  **Use this with caution.**


**Example Resources (This section will be populated based on the contents of the repository):**

* _(Example: EC2 Instance)_  This example might create an EC2 instance with specific instance type, AMI, and security group.
* _(Example: S3 Bucket)_ This example could create an S3 bucket with specific configuration (versioning, encryption, etc.).
* _(Example: VPC)_   This could create a virtual private cloud with subnets, internet gateway, etc.

**Customization:**

Modify the variables in `variables.tf` to customize the resources.  For example, you can change the instance type, AMI ID, or other parameters to suit your needs.


**Note:**  This is a template.  You need to populate the `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files with the actual Terraform code to create the desired AWS resources.  Remember to follow AWS best practices for security and cost optimization.
